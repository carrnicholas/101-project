      <p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small
        growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in
        journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated
        with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and
        wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs
      </p> <!-- closing p tag -->

  <div class="half-width">
    <p>That curiosity opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how
      to build my first website I realized I had found something that gave me
      the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a
      full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization
      skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code</p>

        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML 5 by hand

          collaborate on, and easy to troubleshoot.</p>

<!-- ***** General comments and notes *****

Q: Differences from original base code
*Meta tags at the top (just for practice)
*Social media contacts at the bottom do not have links, icons only

Q: What is going on in the body tag below with all the divs?

The sections and divs within the section are being used to "build" the
HTML and CSS "box" that was talked about in the lessons. That is why
There are multiple sections called work, about, etc and why there are
full-width, half-width, third-width divs inside of those sections

The section and div tags are for base strucure only, you cannot see them
unless there is content inside them. The structure will become obvious
later once content is added.

The first thing you want to do when building a page is build the non-visible
structure first (i.e. sections and divs) and add the content second

Q: What is going on with the nav bar?

The links in the nav bar are linked to the section IDs on the rest of the page.
The links are actually internal, and once the page is up and running clicking
on one of those links will take you to where that section starts...which I
identified in the base code of the page by using the <section> tag

Q: Getting confused about the left-floated div in the instructions. My first
thought was that you had to use CSS to float somethign left and if there is a
way to do it in HTML, I can't remmeber how to do it. Section at issue is the
"contact" section. Posted the question on Slack for help. A: Yes, it involves
CSS...I just haven't gotten to that section yet!
